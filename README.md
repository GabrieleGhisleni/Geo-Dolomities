# Dolomities exploration
Geospatial project exam for UniTn 2021/22 course.

This project presents a large-scale analyses on the Dolomities investigating, from a geospatial point of view, their morphology and the most important point of interest such as the alpine huts and the major peaks. We will perform a network analyses on all the trails that allow to visit those mountains, generating insightful description and details on the difficulties and possible route to follow, also connecting them to the street network. Lastly we will perform a spatial analyses to understand if there is some correlation in the prices of the alpine huts according to the area in which they are. This report will briefly covers the most important steps, however in the notebooks that are linked is possible to see in detailed the actual implementation and minor features as well with interactive maps.       

all the notebooks already loaded with the interactive maps are visibile at the following link.
